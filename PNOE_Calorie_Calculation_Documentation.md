## System Overview

### What is PNOE?
PNOE is a metabolic testing device that measures an individual's breathing patterns, oxygen consumption (VO2), carbon dioxide production (VCO2), and other metabolic markers during exercise. This provides a detailed picture of how efficiently a person burns calories at different intensity levels.

### Problem Being Solved
Traditional fitness apps use generic formulas to estimate calorie burn, typically based only on heart rate, age, gender, and weight. These estimates can be off by 20-40% because they don't account for individual metabolic differences. Our system uses personalized metabolic data to provide accuracy within 5-10%.

### Solution Overview
1. **Data Collection**: Users undergo PNOE metabolic testing
2. **Data Processing**: Raw PNOE CSV data is processed into personalized coefficients
3. **Real-time Calculation**: During workouts, heart rate is used with personalized algorithms to calculate accurate calorie burn
4. **Continuous Updates**: Calories are calculated and displayed in real-time during workouts

## Data Sources and Requirements

### PNOE CSV File Structure
The system expects CSV files with the following columns:

| Column | Description | Usage |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| `T(sec)` | Time in seconds | Temporal sequencing |
| `HR(bpm)` | Heart rate | Primary input for all calculations |
| `VO2(ml/min)` | Oxygen consumption | VO2 method calculations |
| `VCO2(ml/min)` | CO2 production | RER calculations |
| `RER` | Respiratory Exchange Ratio | Substrate utilization |
| `EE(kcal/min)` | Energy expenditure per minute | Direct calorie calculations |
| `CARBS(%)` | Carbohydrate oxidation percentage | Substrate breakdown |
| `FAT(%)` | Fat oxidation percentage | Substrate breakdown |
| `CARBS(kcal)` | Carbohydrate calories | Detailed substrate analysis |
| `FAT(kcal)` | Fat calories | Detailed substrate analysis |

### Data Quality Requirements
- **Minimum Duration**: At least 10 minutes of test data
- **Heart Rate Range**: Data should span from resting HR to near-maximum effort
- **Data Completeness**: All required columns must have valid numeric values
- **Temporal Consistency**: Data points should be sequential and consistent

## Calculation Methods

### 1. Heart Rate (HR) Method

**Purpose**: Direct mapping of heart rate ranges to calorie burn rates

**Processing**:
- Raw PNOE data is grouped into 10 BPM heart rate zones (e.g., 60-69, 70-79, 80-89)
- For each zone, calculate average calories per minute and substrate utilization percentages
- Store zone boundaries with corresponding calorie rates

**Storage**:
```sql
UserHrCalorieZone {
  hrMin: 60,           -- Zone minimum HR
  hrMax: 69,           -- Zone maximum HR  
  caloriesPerMinute: 8.5,  -- Average calories/min in this zone
  fatPercentage: 75.2,     -- % calories from fat
  carbPercentage: 24.8     -- % calories from carbs
}
```

**Real-time Usage**:
1. Get current heart rate from device/HealthKit
2. Find matching HR zone or interpolate between zones
3. Apply zone's calories-per-minute rate
4. Multiply by workout duration for total calories

**Example**: 
- Current HR: 145 BPM
- Matches zone: 140-149 BPM = 12.3 kcal/min
- After 30 minutes: 12.3 × 30 = 369 calories

### 2. VO2 Method (Weir Equation)

**Purpose**: Use the gold-standard Weir equation for metabolic calculations

**Processing**:
- Create linear regression models: Heart Rate → VO2 and Heart Rate → RER
- Calculate VO2 max (peak oxygen consumption)
- Store regression parameters for both VO2 and RER estimation
- Apply Weir equation for accurate calorie calculation

**Storage**:
```sql
UserVo2Profile {
  estimatedVo2Max: 45.8,           -- Peak VO2 (ml/min)
  vo2EfficiencyCoefficient: 0.0234,  -- Conversion efficiency
  hrVo2Slope: 0.67,                -- HR → VO2 regression slope
  hrVo2Intercept: -12.4,           -- VO2 regression y-intercept
  hrRerSlope: -0.0023,             -- HR → RER regression slope
  hrRerIntercept: 1.105            -- RER regression y-intercept
}
```

**Real-time Usage**:
1. Estimate VO2 from HR: `VO2 = (HR × hrVo2Slope) + hrVo2Intercept`
2. Estimate RER from HR: `RER = (HR × hrRerSlope) + hrRerIntercept`
3. Calculate VCO2: `VCO2 = VO2 × RER`
4. Apply Weir equation: `kcal/min = ((VO2 × 3.9) + (VCO2 × 1.1)) / 1000`

**Example**:
- Current HR: 138 BPM
- Estimated VO2: 2296.1 ml/min (from regression)
- Estimated RER: 0.927 (from regression)
- VCO2: 2296.1 × 0.927 = 2128.5 ml/min
- Calories/min: ((2296.1 × 3.9) + (2128.5 × 1.1)) / 1000 = 11.40 kcal/min

### 3. Respiratory Exchange Ratio (RER) Method

**Purpose**: Use RER-based Weir equation with HR zone-specific RER values

**Processing**:
- Group data into 20 BPM heart rate ranges for RER analysis
- Calculate average RER value for each HR range
- Determine fat and carbohydrate oxidation rates
- Store substrate utilization patterns

**Storage**:
```sql
UserRerMapping {
  hrRangeStart: 120,           -- HR range beginning
  hrRangeEnd: 139,             -- HR range end
  averageRerValue: 0.87,       -- Average RER in this range
  fatOxidationRate: 7.2,       -- Fat calories per minute
  carbOxidationRate: 4.1,      -- Carb calories per minute
  averageEeKcalPerMin: 11.3    -- Total energy expenditure
}
```

**Real-time Usage**:
1. Current HR → Find matching RER range
2. If VO2 profile exists, use Weir equation with zone RER:
   - Estimate VO2 from HR regression
   - Use zone's average RER value
   - Apply Weir equation: `kcal/min = ((VO2 × 3.9) + (VCO2 × 1.1)) / 1000`
3. Otherwise, use pre-calculated averageEeKcalPerMin

**Example**:
- Current HR: 130 BPM → RER range 120-139
- With VO2 profile: Use RER 0.87 in Weir equation
- Without VO2 profile: Use pre-calculated 11.3 kcal/min

### 4. Energy Expenditure (EE) Method

**Purpose**: Direct heart rate to calorie calculation via regression analysis (Doctor's Model 2)

**Processing**:
- Create linear regression: Heart Rate → Energy Expenditure (kcal/min)
- Calculate regression coefficients (slope and intercept)
- Store regression parameters for direct EE calculation
- This matches the doctor's direct HR→EE regression approach

**Storage**:
```sql
UserEeCoefficient {
  baseMetabolicRate: 1.8,      -- Minimum energy expenditure
  hrMultiplier: 0.163587,      -- HR → EE slope (from regression)
  efficiencyFactor: 1.23,      -- Personal vs. standard efficiency
  regressionR2: 0.94,          -- Quality indicator (0-1)
  hrEeIntercept: -11.268514    -- Regression y-intercept
}
```

**Real-time Usage**:
1. Direct calculation: `EE (kcal/min) = (HR × slope) + intercept`
2. Total calories = EE × duration in minutes
3. No additional adjustments needed - direct from regression

**Example** (matching doctor's Excel):
- Current HR: 138 BPM
- EE = (138 × 0.163587) + (-11.268514) = 11.31 kcal/min
- For 30 minutes: 11.31 × 30 = 339.3 kcal

**Storage Reduction**: 90% smaller than raw data
**Access Speed**: Instant coefficient lookup vs. processing large datasets
**Scalability**: Supports thousands of users efficiently

### Database Tables

```sql
-- HR zones (typically 8-12 zones per user)
UserHrCalorieZone: userId, hrMin, hrMax, caloriesPerMinute, fatPercentage, carbPercentage

-- Single profile per user
UserVo2Profile: userId, estimatedVo2Max, vo2EfficiencyCoefficient, hrVo2Slope

-- RER ranges (typically 4-8 ranges per user)  
UserRerMapping: userId, hrRangeStart, hrRangeEnd, averageRerValue, fatOxidationRate

-- Single coefficient set per user
UserEeCoefficient: userId, baseMetabolicRate, hrMultiplier, efficiencyFactor
```

### Data Lifecycle

## Fallback Mechanisms

### Primary Fallback: Generic Calculation
When personalized data is unavailable:
```
Calories/min = Max(1.0, (HeartRate - 60) × 0.1)
```

### Fallback Hierarchy
1. **User's Preferred Method**: (HR/VO2/RER/EE)
2. **Best Available Method**: Highest quality coefficients
3. **Generic Heart Rate Formula**: Basic calculation
4. **HealthKit Data**: iOS health database (if available)
5. **Fixed Rate**: Emergency fallback (1 calorie/minute)

### Quality-Based Selection
- **High Quality** (R² > 0.85): Use personalized method
- **Medium Quality** (R² 0.7-0.85): Use with confidence indicator
- **Low Quality** (R² < 0.7): Show warning, offer fallback
- **No Data**: Automatic fallback to generic calculation
